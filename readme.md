##

This repository contains a simple program written in different HDLs (*Hardware Description Languages*) for the **Colorlight 5a-75e v8.0** board, using **FT232RL as JTAG programmer**. The goal is to provide an easy first setup for the Colorlight board.

*The program is a simple LED controller, which turns ON the LED everytime the input signal is ON.*

### You can find more information on how to setup the hardware/toolchain on my [blog post](https://roby2014-me.vercel.app/programming-a-colorlight-5a-75e-board-ECP5-FPGA-with-open-source-tools/).

## Dependencies
- FPGA toolchain
    - [yosys](https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys) â€“ Yosys Open SYnthesis Suite.
    - [nextpnr-ecp5](https://github.com/YosysHQ/nextpnr) - A portable FPGA place and route tool (for Lattice ECP5 FPGA).
    - [prjtrellis](https://github.com/YosysHQ/prjtrellis) - Device database and tools for bitstream creation (fully open source flow for ECP5 FPGA).
    - [openFPGALoader](https://github.com/trabucayre/openFPGALoader) - Universal utility for programming FPGA 
- git
- make
  
In case you want to run the [VHDL example](./vhdl_example/), you will also need:
- [GHDL](https://github.com/ghdl/ghdl) - VHDL 2008/93/87 simulator.

In case you want to run the [SpinalHDL example](./spinalhdl_example/), you will also need:
- Scala
- sbt
- Java JDK 8+ (tested on `openjdk 19.0.1 2022-10-18`)

## Uploading to FPGA
```
> git clone https://github.com/roby2014/ecp5-ft232rl-example
> cd ecp5-ft232rl-example/[verilog/vhdl/spinalhdl]_example
> make
openFPGALoader --cable ft232RL --pins=RXD:RTS:TXD:CTS led_control.bit
Jtag probe limited to 3MHz
Jtag frequency : requested 6000000Hz -> real 3000000Hz
ret 0
Open file: DONE
Parse file: DONE
Enable configuration: DONE
SRAM erase: DONE
Loading: [==================================================] 100.00%
Done
Disable configuration: DONE
```

After running `make`, the bitstream should be uploaded to the FPGA and you should be able to control the LED via input button.

## Information

When running `make`, this is what happens "*under the hood*":

1. `yosys` synthetizes the Verilog/Vhdl files, generating a `json` file with the RTL information.
2. `nextpnr-ecp5` transforms synthetized RTL code and pin mapping (`lpf` file) into a FPGA config file.
3. `ecppack` generates bitstream from the configuration file.
4. `openFPGALoader` uploads the bitstream into the FPGA via JTAG.

In case you are running the [SpinalHDL example](./spinalhdl_example/), there is an extra step before all of the above:

0. All Scala files from `src/mylib/` are compiled into Verilog files (inside `gen/` folder).

In case you are running the [VHDL example](./vhdl_example/), there is an extra step before all of the above:

0. `GHDL` analyzes all `.vhd` files and elaborates the top entity module.
